Compatability patch between my [Expanded Building List mod](https://github.com/brianstepnitz/expanded_building_list) and the [Expanded Building Grid mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3278156786). Works with the [Dense UI mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3378734097) too!

Load this mod AFTER both Expanded Building Grid / Dense UI AND Expanded Building List.

*Mod written for Victoria 3 patch 1.9.8*

## Modifications

*UI-only â€” no gameplay changes.*

- Fixed a bug from vanilla where Buildings would sometimes appear multiple times in list mode.

### Additions
